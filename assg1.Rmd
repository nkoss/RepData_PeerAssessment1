## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
inp <- read.csv("activity.csv")

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
totalSteps <- tapply(inp$steps, inp$date, sum, simplify=TRUE)
mean <- mean(totalSteps, na.rm=TRUE)
median <- median(totalSteps, na.rm=TRUE)

```
The mean total number of steps per day is `r mean` and median is `r median`  
```{r}
hist(totalSteps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values
```{r}
missing <- sum(is.na(inp$steps))

```
There are `r missing` missing rows in the dataset

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
